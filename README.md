# opencv_practice

### A collection of practice scripts and classes for Computer Vision using the OpenCV2 library

## video_games/realtime_object_detection.py
Takes three arguments:
* Window Name (Windows)
* Path to an image of the object to track

As of now, this script only accepts a single image. This limitation means that this script is only useful for 2D or isometric games with static sprites. However, the detection threshold can be adjusted to change sensitivity.
